# Beyond the Canvas
Welcome to Stupid Hackathon Thailand #6, 1st challenge, **Beyond the Canvas**.

In this challenge, you are tasks to answer 1 of the 10 questions you're confident in the most.
But please note that, these questions is well curated, and required a lot of creativity to complete one.

The client you will use is a custom made CLI or this repo.

## Prerequisted
- [Node.js 14+](https://nodejs.org)
    - For Mac user:
        ```bash
        brew install nodejs
        ```
    - For Linux with `apt`:
        ```bash
        apt install nodejs
        ```

    - For Arch Linux users:
        ```bash
        pacman -S nodejs
        ```

    - For Windows users with chocolately:
        ```bash
        choco install nodejs
        ```

## Getting Start
So to get started, just clone the repo, install package, build, and then start the CLI.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saltyaom/stpd6-cli && \
    cd stpd6-cli && \
    npm install && \
    npm run build && \
    node build
```

To run the CLI:
```bash

The rest of an instruction is `await you` in the CLI.

May the fortune favors the bold.
